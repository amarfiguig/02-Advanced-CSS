# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Website construction

Create a website using the skills learned during the second week course in order to showcase the experience as a profile

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
this challange took about two days to write, search, copy and debug, it still needs work, checking, and deleting some frozen code
I have a problem with the "navbar" I'm trying to route and debug.
Note: The current form of the site is the interface to be accessed. There are only some revisions, correction of codes and their arrangement, and overcoming some problems.
Here a lot of unwanted code has been added for the purpose of tabs and creating other paths for the aesthetic of the site. 
Please ignore it, as it has no role in the site after deleting some branches.
