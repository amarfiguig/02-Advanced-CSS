The site is not complete
With the help of distinguished professors and learning via the Internet
This site was created and built by a student at the University of Birmingham studying coding

Please point me to the errors and help in solving them, I am still learning

Best Regards

--It took about two days to write, search, copy and debug, it still needs work, checking, and deleting some frozen code
I have a problem with the "navbar" I'm trying to route and debug.
Note: The current form of the site is the interface to be accessed. There are only some revisions, correction of codes and their arrangement, and overcoming some problems.
Here a lot of unwanted code has been added for the purpose of tabs and creating other paths for the aesthetic of the site. 
Please ignore it, as it has no role in the site after deleting some branches.
I apologize for the lack of order and signaling in the codes I will fixed  soon as possible.--
